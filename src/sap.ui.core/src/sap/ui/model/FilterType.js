	 * one for filters defined by the control that owns the binding, and another list for filters that
	 * an application can define in addition. When executing the filter operation, both sets
	 * of filters are combined.
	 *
	 * See method {@link sap.ui.model.ListBinding#filter ListBinding#filter} on how to specify the
	 * filter type. When no filter type is given to that method, the behavior depends on the specific
	 * model implementation and should be documented in the API reference for that model.
