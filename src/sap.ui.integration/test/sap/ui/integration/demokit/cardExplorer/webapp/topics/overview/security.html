			<h1 id="security">Security Policy</h1>
			<p>
				The following section provides information about security aspects of UI Integration Cards.
				This information is intended for UI Integration Cards authors and system administrators managing applications embedding UI Integration Cards.
			</p>

			<h2 id="author-responsibility">Card Author Responsibility</h2>
			<p>
				The card author is fully responsible for the card's security.
				The framework enables the use of established security best practices but does not eliminate the need for careful implementation.
				<br>UI Integration Cards and underlying SAPUI5 framework are client-side JavaScript libraries, so while the libraries themself are designed
				and tested to be secure, they cannot ensure the end-to-end card security.
				<br>The author must follow security best practices and guidelines, including <a data-demokit-href="#/topic/91f3d8706f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070" target="_blank">SAPUI5 framework best practices</a>.
			</p>

			<h2 id="special-attention">Cards Requiring Special Attention</h2>
			<p>
				Component cards, Web Page cards and cards with Extension need special attention by the author
				due to their increased flexibility and potential for security-related misconfigurations or coding issues.
				Follow SAP Product security standards and SAPUI5 best practices to avoid security mistakes.
			</p>

			<h2 id="trust-requirement">Trust Requirement for Integrating Cards</h2>
			<p>
				For each host product environment, integrating a card requires trust in its author, whether the author is a developer, end user, 
				or a Large Language Model (LLM). Content generated by LLMs must be reviewed and validated by a developer or administrator before use.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>JavaScript Extensions and Page Access:</strong>
					Because <a href="../../index.html#/learn/features/extension" target="_parent">JavaScript extensions</a> can be added,
					the card author has access to the hosting page, introducing elevated security risk.
					The same applies for Component Cards and WebPage Cards.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Administrator and Developer Verification:</strong>
					Administrators or developers must verify the security of each integrated card or explicitly trust the card author before deployment.
				</li>
			</ul>
